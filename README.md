# Hull-Speed-CE
This simple program calculates the theoretical hull speed of a sailing vessel measured in feet or meters. You decide your unit of measurement and input the LWL, and the calculator will give you the theoretical hull speed in knots.

This is a great app to have if you are looking at purchasing a new boat and want to know how fast the hull is capable of travelling in the water. It is also great if you are a professional mariner and wish to settle a bet about your ship's poorly designed.

Fair winds and following seas!
